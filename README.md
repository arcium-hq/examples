# Arcium Examples

This repository contains example applications demonstrating how to build confidential applications on Solana using Arcium's Multi-Party Computation (MPC) network. Each example showcases different aspects of privacy-preserving computation while maintaining transparency and verifiability on the blockchain.

## Getting Started

To build and run these examples, you'll need:

- Rust toolchain
- Solana CLI tools  
- Anchor framework
- Access to Arcium's MPC network

For detailed setup instructions, check out our [Developer Documentation](https://docs.arcium.com/developers).

## Examples

### Gaming Applications

**[Blackjack](./blackjack/)** - A complete blackjack game where card values remain hidden throughout gameplay. Demonstrates complex game state management with encrypted data structures and multi-step MPC computations for card dealing, player actions, and game resolution.

**[Coin Flip](./coinflip/)** - A simple heads-or-tails game showcasing secure random number generation within MPC. Players submit encrypted choices that are compared against cryptographically secure randomness generated by the network.

**[Rock Paper Scissors](./rock_paper_scissors/)** - Two variants of the classic game:
- **[Player vs Player](./rock_paper_scissors/against-player/)** - Both players submit secret moves that are revealed and compared simultaneously
- **[Player vs House](./rock_paper_scissors/against-house/)** - Player competes against randomly generated house moves

### Governance & Privacy

**[Confidential Voting](./voting/)** - Anonymous polling system where individual votes remain private while still enabling verifiable tallying. Demonstrates how to maintain voter privacy while ensuring election integrity.

**[Medical Records Sharing](./share_medical_records/)** - Privacy-preserving healthcare data sharing between authorized parties. Shows how sensitive personal information can be shared selectively while maintaining confidentiality.

## How Arcium Works

All examples follow the same architectural pattern:

1. **Solana Programs** handle public state management and user interactions
2. **Encrypted Instructions** define confidential computations that run on Arcium's MPC network  
3. **Callback Functions** process results from MPC computations back on-chain

The MPC network ensures that sensitive data remains encrypted during computation, with only the necessary results revealed publicly.
